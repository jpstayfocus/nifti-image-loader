## Outline

1- Get familiar with C++â€™s IO tools and concurrency. The goal is to create a Nifti
image loader which is capable of asynchronously reading .nii files from disk and then displaying the image on an
OpenGL texture.

2- Extend the work from assignment 4 to handle 4D images (functional
MRI) as well as the 3D structural images in 1.
